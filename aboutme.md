title: About me
---

My name is Zakaria Lahgazi-Alaoui, but everyone calls me Zak. I am 25 years old and I try to balance having a good time with thinking for the future. I relocated to the United Kingdom from New Zealand in May 2025 to experience new things and better expose myself to the world.

### My story

I was born in the UK on April 1st 2000, and moved to NZ what I was 5 where I was raised and became a kiwi. I attended Papakowhai School for years 1 - 8, Aotea College for years 8 - 13, and the University of Otago where I attained a Bachelor's Degree of Applied Science, majoring in Data Science, minoring in Computer Science. I have worked in the NZ central government COVID-19 response and for the Tertiary Education Commission helping to maintain, access, and build on the data that the tertiary education system relied on.
